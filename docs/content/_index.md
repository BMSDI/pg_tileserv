`pg_tileserv` is a [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)-only tile server in [Go](https://golang.org/).
 Strip away all the other requirements, it just has to take in HTTP tile request
s and form and execute SQL.  In a sincere act of flattery, the API and design look a lot like that of the [Martin](https://github.com/urbica/martin) tile server.
